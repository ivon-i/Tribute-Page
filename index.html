        <h3 id=headline> A brief timeline of Shakespeare's career: </h3>
        <div class="timeline">
          <p> <strong> <span class="bigger"> 1564: </span> </strong> William is born in Stratford-upon-Avon. The precise date of his birth is unknown, but is commonly believed to be either 21, 22 or 23 April, with the latter date – St George’s Day – being the most popular date to celebrate. </p>
          <p> <strong> <span class="bigger"> 1580s: </span> </strong> Sometime between 1585 and 1589, his writing and acting career begins, still in his hometown. </p>
          <p> <strong> <span class="bigger"> 1592: </span> </strong> The earliest known record of his residency in London. It was during that time that he wrote 'Henry VI Part 1', 'Henry VI Part 2', 'The Two Gentlemen of Verona' and 'Titus Andronicus', though it is debated which of these was actually the first. </p>
          <p> <strong> <span class="bigger"> 1593: </span> </strong> London's theatres are closed for a period of around 2 years due to the bubonic plague. </p>
          <p> <strong> <span class="bigger"> 1594: </span> </strong> The Lord Chamberlain's Men is formed. For almost twenty years Shakespeare was its regular dramatist, producing an average of two plays a year. 'The Comedy of Errors' is also believed to be written and performed for the first time.</p>
          <p> <strong> <span class="bigger"> 1599: </span> </strong> The company takes residence at The Globe. The first play performed at the newly-opened theatre is 'King Henry V'. </p>
          <p> <strong> <span class="bigger"> 1600-7: </span> </strong> Plays including 'Hamlet' and 'Macbeth' are wrriten. The latter's first recorded perfomance takes place in 1607 aboard the East India Company ship Red Dragon, off the coast of Sierra Leone. </p>
          <p> <strong> <span class="bigger"> 1608: </span> </strong> Returns to live in Stratford, continuing to write plays for several years, including 'The Tempest' (1610). </p>
          <p> <strong> <span class="bigger"> 1613: </span> </strong> The Globe burns down after a stage cannon misfire during a 'Henry VIII' performance but is quickly rebuilt (at the cost of £1400). Also the year Shakespeare is believed to have retired from writing.</p>
          <p> <strong> <span class="bigger"> 1616: </span> </strong> Dies at home, aged 52. Cause of death is unknown.</p>
